# EasyRecipes
Easily make custom crafting recipes. Supports custom items as both the ingredients and the result!

## Sub-commands
*The master command for EasyRecipes is `/easyrecipes` or `/er`.*
- `create` - Opens a menu for the user to place ingredients and a result for a custom recipe.
- `delete <recipe name>` - Deletes a custom recipe.
- `list` - Shows a list of the current custom recipes loaded by the plugin. Use the names from this command for the `delete` sub-command.

## Permissions
- `easyrecipes.*` - Wildcard permission for EasyRecipes. Includes the below permissions.
- `easyrecipes.create` - Allows for the creation of custom recipes.
- `easyrecipes.delete` - Allows for the deletion of custom recipes.
- `easyrecipes.list` - Allows for the viewing of current custom recipes.

## Warnings
- DO NOT edit the `recipes.yml` file! Doing so can potentially break the entire plugin!
- This plugin is currently a prototype. I will NOT provide support until I release a stable version.
