# EasyRecipes
Easily make custom crafting recipes. Supports custom items as both the ingredients and the result!

`/createrecipe` is currently the only command. It opens a menu for you to shape your recipe and insert the resulting item. All items placed in the menu will be returned and hopefully the recipe is added without issue.
Recipes are stored in a file using Base64 encoding and recipes should load at server startup just fine. Good luck editing it yourself.

WARNING - THIS PLUGIN IS CURRENTLY A PROTOTYPE. I WILL NOT PROVIDE SUPPORT UNTIL I MAKE A FULL RELEASE VERSION.
